# Apps and IDEs

## Editing

I tried :

- VS Code
- VIM
- WebStorm
- Sublime Text
- Another one on Mac I forgot the name...
- Notepad++ (oh old html courses...)

There is not only one good IDE, but here is what I'd recommend today.

Beginner and learning? Go for VS Code.

Professionnal web dev? Go for WebStorm.

Want something basic and yet as much fast as cool? VIM is for you.

I love using WebStorm everyday. It's not perfect, VS Code does a lot that WebStorm proposes with a licence to buy, though it just fits right. Versioning becomes a child play, debugging is well implemented, the interface is great.

## API

Postman is great and famous.

I love the interface of Insomnia.

## Time tracking

Toggl Track is great, even though I would like to find a nice open source equivalent.
