# Beginner

## Language

Choose a combination of:

- A language capable of doing what you want to create (video games, rockets, audio engineering, web).
- A language fitting the actual market (monster.com and LinkedIn may help you find out, some charts exists and can be found online).

## Should I make notes?

Depends on everyone.

I took some. Then stopped. They did it again in a different way.

My way is to make notes on the books I'm reading, then at the end of the chapter and at the end of the book I go back on them.

I prefer taking notes on paper as a pen forces me to write only what matters.

But again, you should try following your feelings. You'll find your way.

## Should I go to a school?

I did learnt by being at an online school, delivering official diplomas.

I learnt mostly aside.

Some people need guidance and a community of students. Some don't.

I can only say going to a school won't make you a great developer. Only learning is.

(I'm getting better and better at answering without answering, don't thank me)

## Where should I learn, for web developing? 

I dev mostly for web, and for that branch I'd recommend paid VODs, like [frontendmasters](frontendmasters.com) or [codewithmosh](codewithmosh.com), or books like [You Don't Know JS (free)](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/README.md).

There are plenty of free stuff out there, and some or great! Though, most of them neither don't go deep enough or don't know how to teach. 

For free, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Tutorials) does a wonderful job. Following official docs may some times be a great idea. For example, [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#learn-react) did a great work!

## What will make me a good developer?

- Your personality
- Your habits
- And only then your knowledge

At least, that's what I think.

There's a reason why this repo started whith this quote:

> “I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits.”
> Kent Beck

### Your personality

Be aware becoming a great developer is a life-work. You will not get to a point some time thinking "oh great, now I'm so good I can just rest and be happy". Fact is, you'll never be happy. No sorry, that's not what I meant, you'll never be **resting**.

Ok jokes aside just go into that path if you're willing to learn all your life.

Then humility may be a quality. 

Taking care of yourself is a real precious tool, that as a great impact on both your productivity and success. Not kidding here!

#### Sleep

There are many ways to sleep. The 9-hour straight, the 2*4 hours, the vampire-only-doing-nap thing.

What's important though:

- Regularity.
- Listening to your body and letting him choose for you.
