# Websites to learn from

I have a few websites nested in my heart.

When I'm thinking about quality of learning and fair price, I think about them:

- [frontendmasters](https://frontendmasters.com)
- [codewithmosh](https://codewithmosh.com)
- [executeprogram](https://executeprogram.com)

## Udemy and YouTube

I bet there are a few great courses here, but globally I would not recommend to go there for learning.

If you're budget is short, usually official documentations and truely handy and efficient.
