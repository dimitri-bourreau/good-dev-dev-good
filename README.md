Here are some resources I've tried out and my opinion on them.

I dev mostly JavaScript but this may interest every one.

- [Books](./books.md) 
- [Blogs](./blogs.md)
- [Free VOD](./free-vod.md)
- [Paid VOD](./paid-vod.md)
- [Apps and IDEs](./apps-and-ides.md)

## This repository 
I am a developer since about one year and a half. 

Some more junior developers often come to me asking for guidance or help.

This repository aims to answer to them. üôÇ

I even have a whole part dedicated to the [beginners](./beginner.md).

## English

I'll talk english. English is important for every developer and should be learnt if necessary!

> En France üá´üá∑ je recommande [les livres des √©ditions Eni](https://www.editions-eni.fr/) ! 
> 
> Je ne recommande ni YouTube, ni Openclassrooms : soit trop bref, soit pas assez p√©dagogues.

## My relation to books

I began to learn to dev around 2018. I've started being a contractor in late 2019.

Until 2020 I only learnt from online resources such as videos, blogs or paid VOD.

I'll recommend some, though I've discovered books are an amazing tool to become a better developer!
