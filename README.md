Here are some resources I've tried out and my opinion on them.

I dev mostly JavaScript but this may interest every one.

- [Beginner](./beginner.md)
- [Books](./books.md)
- [Website to learn from](./websites-to-learn-from.md)
- [Blogs, newsletters and websites](./blogs-newsletters-and-websites.md)
- [Free VOD](./free-vod.md)
- [Paid VOD](./paid-vod.md)
- [Apps and IDEs](./apps-and-ides.md)

## This repository

I am a developer since 2019, August.

Some more junior developers often come to me asking for guidance or help.

This repository aims to answer to them. üôÇ

I even have a whole part dedicated to the [beginners](./beginner.md).

## English

I'll talk english. English is important for every developer and should be learnt if necessary!

> En France üá´üá∑ je recommande [les livres des √©ditions Eni](https://www.editions-eni.fr/) !
>
> Je ne recommande ni YouTube, ni Openclassrooms : soit trop bref, soit pas assez p√©dagogues.

## My relation to books

I began to learn to dev around 2018. I've started being a contractor in late 2019.

Until 2020 I only learnt from online resources such as videos, blogs or paid VOD.

I'll recommend some, though I've discovered books are an amazing tool to become a better developer!
